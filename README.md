# Learning Rate Optimization

This repository explores different learning rate optimization techniques for deep learning models.

## Methods Included:
- **LR Finder**: Finds the optimal learning rate by gradually increasing it.
- **One-Cycle Policy**: Adjusts learning rate dynamically during training.
- **Manual Tuning**: Grid search for the best learning rate.

## Installation
```sh
pip install torch torch_lr_finder
